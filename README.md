- In this project, I've learned how to structure and style a multi-page website using HTML and SCSS (Sass), incorporating modern web development practices. Here's a brief overview of what I've covered:  

### Technologies Used:  
1. **HTML**:  
   - Structure: I structured my web pages using semantic HTML, which improves accessibility and SEO.  

2. **SCSS (Sass)**:  
   - Variables: I used SCSS variables for managing color schemes (`$color-black`, `$color-second`, etc.), which enhances consistency and maintainability.  
   - Nesting: I employed nested rules, making the stylesheet more readable and logically organized.  
   - Mixins: I used mixins (`@include tablet`, `@include desktop`) for media queries, which reduces code repetition and   simplifies responsive design.  
   - Loops: I utilized loops (`@for`) in SCSS for generating repetitive code, showcasing advanced usage of Sass.  

3. **Responsive Design**:  
   - Media Queries: I applied media queries for different breakpoints (`tablet`, `desktop`), ensuring my website looks good on various devices.  
   - Flexbox: I used Flexbox (`display: flex`, `justify-content`, `align-items`) for layout, providing a flexible and efficient way to arrange items within a container.  
   - Grid Layout: I implemented CSS Grid for complex layouts, making it easier to create responsive grid-based designs.  

4. **CSS Transitions**:  
   - Smooth Transitions: I used CSS transitions (`transition: all $transion`) to enhance user interactions with smooth animations.  

5. **Accessibility**:  
   - Semantic HTML: Using semantic elements improves the accessibility of my web pages.  
   - Responsive Images: Ensuring images adapt to different screen sizes improves the user experience across devices.  

6. **Best Practices**:  
   - DRY Principle: By using variables, mixins, and loops in SCSS, I adhered to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle, making my code more efficient and easier to maintain.  
   - BEM Naming Convention: The use of BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) methodology (`.about__title`, `.category-prod__photos-container`) for naming classes makes my CSS more readable and modular.  

  By combining these skills, I've built a responsive, interactive website for a fictional brand (BOSE) that showcases various products, provides navigation  through a menu, and incorporates modern web design principles for a seamless user experience across devices.    

3. To run project:
