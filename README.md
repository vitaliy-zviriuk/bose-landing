1. Technologies were used: HTML, SCSS, JS.

2. In this project, I've learned how to structure and style a multi-page website using HTML and SCSS (Sass), incorporating modern web development practices. Here's a brief overview of what I've covered:  

  HTML Structure:  
    1. Document Structure: Utilized proper HTML5 semantic elements (!DOCTYPE htm, html, head, body) to structure the webpage.  
    2. Sections and Navigation: Created multiple sections (header, nav, mai>, footer) to organize content effectively.  
    3. Links and Images: Employed 'a' tags for navigation links and img tags for embedding images with appropriate alt attributes.  

  SCSS (Sass) Styling:  
    1. Variables and Mixins: Defined reusable styles using variables (e.g., $color-black, $transion) and mixins (@mixin desktop, @mixin tablet) to ensure consistency and maintainability across 
      different screen sizes.  
    2. Nested Selectors: Used nested selectors to encapsulate styles for specific components (&__title, &__subtitle) within their parent elements.  
    3. Responsive Design: Implemented responsive design techniques (@include tablet, @include desktop) to adjust layout and typography based on different viewport sizes.  

  JavaScript Interaction:  
    1. Event Listeners: Implemented JavaScript (main.js) to handle interactions such as toggling classes based on URL hash changes (window.addEventListener('hashchange')) and form submissions (form.addEventListener('submit')).  
    2. DOM Manipulation: Used document.querySelector() and querySelectorAll() to access and manipulate DOM elements dynamically based on user interactions.  

  Additional Concepts:  
    1. Fonts and Icons: Integrated Google Fonts (Inter) and included custom SVG icons (favicon.svg) for improved aesthetics and accessibility.  
    2. External Resources: Linked external CSS (main.scss) and JavaScript (main.js) files, improving modularity and maintainability of the project.  
    3. Accessibility: Ensured accessibility by providing meaningful alternative text (alt attributes) for images and using semantic HTML elements for better screen reader compatibility.  

  Project Structure:  
    1. Organized stylesheet (main.scss) using modular imports (@import) for different components (header, menu, about, products, etc.) to maintain a structured and scalable codebase.  
    2. Employed SCSS features like nesting, mixins, and variables to enhance code readability and streamline CSS development.  

  By combining these skills, I've built a responsive, interactive website for a fictional brand (BOSE) that showcases various products, provides navigation through a menu, and incorporates modern web design principles for a seamless user experience across devices.   

3. To run project:
